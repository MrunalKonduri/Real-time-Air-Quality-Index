Real time Air Quality Index

Air pollution has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental challenges globally, particularly in developing nations like India. The increasing levels of harmful pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, and NH‚ÇÉ are largely driven by industrial activities, vehicular emissions, and urban expansion. These pollutants not only deteriorate air quality but also pose significant health risks to the population, especially in densely populated urban areas.
